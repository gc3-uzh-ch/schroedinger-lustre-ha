HA tests
========

Single host failures
--------------------

- FC
    - unlink first cable
        - check
    - unlink second one
        - behaviour ?

- IB
    - unlink cable
        - behaviour ?
    - block ICMP
        - behaviour ?
    - unlink cable + service rdma stop, if needed?
        - behaviour ?
        
- ethernet (do we have another interface available on hosts, and ports on switch?)
    - unlink cable
    - what if eth0.617 is not available?
        - op monitor on-fail=fence  on the stonith primitive?


Multiple hosts failure
----------------------

- what if both the mds are down?
    - do we need another check on pacemaker?
- what about the quorum? if 5 hosts are down?
    - behaviour? 



Tests on lustre-test{1,2}
-------------------------

test HA
	- unlink first SAS, ok
	- unlink second SAS
		- fail of filesystem monitoring
		- trying to stop target on failing node
		- timeout on stop operation -> FENCING
	
	- when machine reboots, still SAS unlinked
		- node resources unmounted
		- trying to start target
		
		
	- ib test
		- physically unlink ib0
			- migration OK
			- failback OK when relink
		- ifdown ib0
			- migration OK
			- failback OK when ifup
		- why no stonith?
			- timeout need to be less then repeat_count * repeat_interval ?
